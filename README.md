# Machine-Learning-using-CPP
This repo has implementation of multiple Machine Learning algorithms in C++. Why? well why not? 
CPP has better system level memory management and the code looks cooler than python honestly. One thing I must say is that implementing decison trees,XGBoost from scratch in CPP are much much easier than implementing them in python mainly because of use of pointers in CPP. 
This project has given us in-depth knowledge of CPP syntax and base level working of Machhine Learning models.
